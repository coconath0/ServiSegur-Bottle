## Database Configuration

The project uses a SQLite database to store information. To configure the database connection, follow the steps below:

1. Ensure you have SQLite installed on your system.

2. Open the `database.py` file and look for the following lines of code:

```python
import os
from sqlalchemy import create_engine
from sqlalchemy.ext.declarative import declarative_base
from sqlalchemy.orm import sessionmaker

# Database connection using SQLite in /db/AppServi.db:
engine = create_engine('sqlite:///db/AppServi.db')
session_db = sessionmaker()
session_db.configure(bind=engine)
```

3. If you want to change the location or name of the database, modify the connection string `'sqlite:///db/AppServi.db'` according to your preferences.
